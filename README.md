# Yusuf Saleem

Hi, my name is Yusuf and I am a  highly ambitions, self-motivated, and driven, software engineer based in Vancouver, Canada.

I graduated from Simon Fraser University, British Columbia in 2022 with a BS in Computer Science and have been working as an engineer ever since.

I enjoy gaming, building websites, and studying Japanese. I am always looking for ways to leverage my hobbies to help others.

I believe that learning  never stops. I continually seek ways to push my technical boundaries while also fostering my creative expression. I'm enthusiastic about my career path ahead and am always open to new opportunities. ðŸ™‚
